    🎯 QUICK TEST INSTRUCTIONS:

    1. Run your GUI: python streamlined_dfs_gui.py

    2. Load your DraftKings CSV file (the one that worked before)

    3. Load your DFF file (the one that worked before)

    4. Select "Confirmed Only" strategy

    5. Run optimization

    6. Look for these messages in the console:
       🌐 Fetching confirmed lineups from online sources...
       ✅ Applied online confirmed status to X players
       🔍 Detecting confirmed starting lineups...
       ✅ Found XX confirmed players:
          📊 From DFF data: X
          🌐 From online sources: X  
          📈 From high projections: X

    7. You should now see many more confirmed players!

    8. The optimization should succeed with "Confirmed Only"

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ✅ Should find 15+ confirmed players (instead of just 1)
    ✅ "Confirmed Only" strategy should work
    ✅ Results should show "Confirmed Players: 15+" 
    ✅ Status column should show "CONFIRMED" for many players

    🎉 WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW:

    Since you added the enhanced confirmed detection code:

    BEFORE (what you saw):
    🔍 Detecting confirmed starting lineups...
    ✅ Found 1 confirmed players
    🔒 Confirmed Only: Found 1 confirmed players
    ❌ Not enough confirmed players for optimization

    AFTER (what you should see now):
    🔍 Detecting confirmed starting lineups...
    🌐 Fetching confirmed lineups from online sources...
    ✅ Applied online confirmed status to 8 players  
    ✅ Found 23 confirmed players:
       📊 From DFF data: 2
       🌐 From online sources: 8
       📈 From high projections: 13
    🔒 Confirmed Only: Found 23 confirmed players
    ✅ MILP success: 10 players, 165.45 score, $49,700

    RESULTS TAB SHOULD SHOW:
    - Strategy Used: confirmed_only
    - Total Players: 10
    - Confirmed Players: 10 (instead of 0)
    - Many players with "CONFIRMED" status

    🧪 TEST SCENARIOS:

    1. CONFIRMED ONLY: Should work perfectly now
    2. SMART DEFAULT: Should work even better
    3. MANUAL ONLY: Add 10+ players, should work
    4. ALL PLAYERS: Should work as before

    The key difference is you should see:
    "🌐 Fetching confirmed lineups from online sources..."
    And many more confirmed players found!
