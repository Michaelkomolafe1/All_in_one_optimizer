## üîß **OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS NOW ACTIVE**

### **Correlation Value (Small Cash)**:
```python
value_threshold = 3.5        # More selective (was 3.0)
value_boost = 1.08          # Optimized reward
team_total_threshold = 5.0   # High-scoring games (was 4.5)
team_total_boost = 1.06     # Enhanced boost
```

### **Pitcher Dominance (Medium Cash)**:
```python
k_rate_threshold_high = 10.5    # Elite only (was 10.0)
k_rate_boost_high = 1.25        # Bigger rewards (was 1.20)
k_rate_threshold_low = 8.5      # Higher bar
expensive_hitter_penalty = 0.98 # Lighter penalty (was 0.95)
```

### **Tournament Winner GPP (Large Cash)**:
```python
k_rate_threshold = 10.5         # Elite pitchers (was 10.0)
k_rate_boost = 1.25            # Bigger rewards (was 1.20)
team_total_threshold = 5.2      # High-scoring games (was 5.0)
ownership_boost = 1.12          # Stronger contrarian edge (was 1.08)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **SAFETY MEASURES**

### **Backup Available**:
```bash
# If rollback needed (unlikely):
cp dfs_optimizer_v2/strategies_v2_backup.py dfs_optimizer_v2/strategies_v2.py
```

### **Monitoring Recommendations**:
1. **Track real-world win rates** vs simulation predictions (55-60% target)
2. **Monitor ROI performance** (should be strongly positive)
