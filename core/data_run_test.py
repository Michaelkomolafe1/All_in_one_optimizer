The enhanced_score is being set to a fixed value somewhere.
Possibilities:
1. The score_players method has a bug
2. All enrichment values are the same (0.0 or 1.0)
3. The scoring formula collapses to position-based constants

Check dfs_optimizer/core/unified_core_system.py
Look for where enhanced_score is set in score_players()
