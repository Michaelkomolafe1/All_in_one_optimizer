# DFS Strategy Tournament Framework

## üéØ **OVERVIEW**

This framework tests your **exact DFS strategies** against realistic competition using your actual MILP optimizer. It answers the key question: **"Are my strategies truly the best?"**

## üèóÔ∏è **WHAT'S INCLUDED**

### **Core Files**:
- `realistic_dfs_simulator.py` - Main simulation engine with real DFS research data
- `realistic_simulation_core.py` - Parallel processing core with proper variance
- `strategy_tournament.py` - Bridge between your optimizer and simulation
- `strategy_variants.py` - Alternative strategy approaches for comparison
- `run_strategy_tests.py` - Main testing interface
- `test_framework.py` - Quick verification test

### **Your Strategies Being Tested**:
```python
CASH STRATEGIES:
- Small Slates: Pitcher Dominance (80% documented win rate)
- Medium Slates: Projection Monster (72% documented win rate)  
- Large Slates: Projection Monster (74% documented win rate)

GPP STRATEGIES:
- Small Slates: Tournament Winner GPP
- Medium Slates: Tournament Winner GPP
- Large Slates: Correlation Value
```

## üöÄ **HOW TO RUN TESTS**

### **Quick Test (2 minutes)**:
```bash
python simulation/run_strategy_tests.py
# Select option 1
```

### **Full Tournament (15 minutes)**:
```bash
python simulation/run_strategy_tests.py  
# Select option 2
```

### **Cash Focus (10 minutes)**:
```bash
python simulation/run_strategy_tests.py
# Select option 3
```

### **GPP Focus (10 minutes)**:
```bash
python simulation/run_strategy_tests.py
# Select option 4
```

## üìä **WHAT GETS TESTED**

### **Your Exact System**:
- ‚úÖ Your actual `DFSPipeline` and `StrategyManager`
- ‚úÖ Your real MILP optimizer from `optimize_lineups()`
- ‚úÖ Your exact strategy logic (K-rate boosts, team totals, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Your scoring engine and parameter values

### **Against Realistic Competition**:
- **Elite Players (5%)**: ML-optimized, advanced metrics
- **Sharp Players (15-25%)**: Smart stacking, ownership awareness  
- **Good Players (30-35%)**: Projection-focused with some strategy
- **Average Players (30-35%)**: Basic projection following
- **Weak Players (10-15%)**: Suboptimal choices

### **Realistic Conditions**:
- **Proper Variance**: 11% std dev, 1% disaster rate, 3% ceiling rate
- **Real Stacking**: Based on 10,330 actual tournament entries
- **Actual Ownership**: Max 0.66% for any stack (research-based)
- **Contest Dynamics**: Proper rake, field sizes, payout structures

## üéØ **WHAT YOU'LL LEARN**

### **Performance Metrics**:
- **Win Rate**: How often you cash/win
- **ROI**: Return on investment percentage
- **Average Score**: Points per lineup
- **Average Rank**: Placement in field
- **Top 10% Rate**: High finish frequency
- **Score Variance**: Consistency measurement

### **Strategy Effectiveness**:
- Which strategies work best for each slate size
- How your strategies perform vs documented win rates
- Whether your parameter values are optimal
- If alternative approaches might be better

### **Competitive Analysis**:
- How you perform against different skill levels
- Whether your strategies have edge vs realistic competition
- If your documented win rates hold up in simulation
- Where improvements might be possible

## üìà **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **If Your Strategies Are Optimal**:
- **Cash Win Rates**: 60-80% (matching your documented rates)
- **GPP Top 10%**: 10-15% (above random 10%)
- **Positive ROI**: +15% to +30% across all contest types
- **Consistent Performance**: Low variance in results

### **If Improvements Are Needed**:
- **Lower Win Rates**: Below documented performance
- **Negative ROI**: Losing money over time
- **High Variance**: Inconsistent results
- **Poor vs Elite**: Struggling against top competition

## üîß **FRAMEWORK FEATURES**

### **Realistic Simulation**:
- Based on actual research: "1.3% of players win 91% of profits"
- Proper MLB variance (highest among all DFS sports)
- Real stacking frequencies and ownership patterns
- Accurate contest dynamics and rake structures

### **Parallel Processing**:
- Uses all CPU cores for fast execution
- Can run thousands of simulations efficiently
- Proper memory management and cleanup
- Statistical significance testing

### **Your Exact System**:
- No modifications to your optimizer
- Uses your real strategies and parameters
- Tests your actual MILP optimization
- Preserves your exact logic and calculations

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS**

### **1. Run Initial Test**:
```bash
python simulation/test_framework.py
```

### **2. Run Quick Tournament**:
```bash
python simulation/run_strategy_tests.py
# Select option 1 for quick test
```

### **3. Analyze Results**:
- Compare win rates to your documented performance
- Look for strategies underperforming expectations
- Identify opportunities for improvement

### **4. If Needed - Parameter Optimization**:
- Test alternative parameter values
- Compare strategy variants
- Optimize based on simulation results

## üèÜ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Your Strategies Are Proven If**:
- ‚úÖ Cash win rates match documented 70-80%
- ‚úÖ GPP top 10% rates exceed 10-12%
- ‚úÖ Positive ROI across all contest types
- ‚úÖ Consistent performance vs all skill levels
- ‚úÖ Results match your real-world experience

### **Improvements Needed If**:
- ‚ùå Win rates significantly below documented
